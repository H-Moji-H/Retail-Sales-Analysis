## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of sales data using Python. The notebook follows a structured workflow covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced analytics, strategic recommendations, and dashboard reporting. The project also incorporates predictive analysis and evaluates scalability considerations.

## Sections
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Identifies and resolves data quality issues.
- Handles missing values and transforms data for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales Overview:**
    Aggregated sales analysis by category and business.
- **Trends Over Time:**
    Visualizing sales trends and time-series plots.
- **Performance Analysis:**
    Identifying top-selling products and businesses.

### 3. Advanced Analysis
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering businesses based on purchasing behavior.
- **Forecasting:** Time-series forecasting using ARIMA.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual spikes or drops in sales using Z-score and rolling mean methods.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examining relationships between different sales variables.

### 4. Strategic Insights and Recommendations
- **Product Strategy:** Recommendations are based on product performance. They are documented in the uploaded notebook.
- **Customer Retention:** Identifying businesses with reduced customer frequency.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Analyzing trends for improved efficiency.

### 5. Dashboard and Reporting
- **Visual Summary:**
  
      1.Sales trends
  2. top-performing products,
  3. and customer segmentation insights.

### 6. Bonus Section
- **Predictive Analysis:** Evaluating external factors influencing sales.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Optimizing data storage, processing, and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
